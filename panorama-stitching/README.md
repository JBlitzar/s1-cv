# Panorama Stitching

Welcome to the subfolder! You'll find development notes in NOTES.md and code in main.py. `uv run main.py` to run. I'll hopefully update this with more explanations on the code and the images that it produces, but I'll try to write in NOTES.md as I go so you'll be able to see that.
