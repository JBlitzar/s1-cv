# seam carving

## Run demo

`uv run main.py`

If you go ahead and run main.py with out.png open in an image viewer that refreshes automatically (like vscode) you'll see the seams getting selected and removed gradually. The other image files / gifs were just testing things messing around. My original implementation was in oop.py following an object-oriented approach based on the dynamic programming solution from Wikipedia. main.py is refactored for speed to just do array operations in bulk instead of having each pixel be an instance.
